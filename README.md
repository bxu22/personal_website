## Walkthrough of Website

#### Home page

The default page is the homepage. Users would default to this page when first entering the website. The page contains a little introduction of me and an image of me holding a bowling ball.

#### Resume page

The next tab page is the resume page. Users can see my resume. My resume consists of my revelative coursework, my projects, and my skills.

#### Contact page

The last tab page is my contact page. Users can obtain my contact information to report any concerns or have any questions for follow-up after going through my website.

## Possible Improvements to Website

There are a bunch of things that can be improved on this website but was time gated.
1. There weren't a lot of images that will appeal to the user that would maintain their retention on my page.
2. The homepage is quite simple in my opinion and can be improved on. I could go in detail about the things that I do at Illinois Institute of Technology. Also, the image that I posted was about 4 years ago, when I was bowling back during highschool since I didn't have any recent images of me bowling at university due to the pandemic.
3. For my resume page, I could have added another project in my Projects section. I recently created an app that gathers news within the last 24 hours through API calls and has the option to catergorizes the topic that interests the user.
4. As for my contact page, additional things could have been added. For example, an automated email messagener on the website can be added to simplify the process instead of the user having to redirect their webpage to their email domain.
